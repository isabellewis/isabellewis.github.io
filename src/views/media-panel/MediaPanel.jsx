              With accessibility becoming increasingly important to consider in
              development it's easy to start with the basic building blocks of
              the page. This talk will go into detail about how we can achieve
              accessible markup by looking at semantic HTML and give practical
              ways to introduce this into the code we write every day. We will
              also look at some tools we can use to test the accessibility of a
              webpage.

              It was great to be asked to talk on VivaWomen's Ready For Anything
              panel. The event opened up conversations for women at different
              stages of their career and reflected on the challenges faced along
              with how to break barriers down.
